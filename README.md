# Week 01 â€“ Exercises 01
(Git&Github - Requires lecture about git & github from week 01)


1. Create a project in Java (Or any programming language of your choice!).

	+ Your program will invert the values of two variables. Start by assigning values to two integer variables; e.g. a =10 and b =20. Print those values with the println command. Your task now is to switch the values stored in the variables and so print again a and b. Next time you print a and b, they should have the values 20 and 10 respectively.
	+ After finishing the coding part, you should create a remote repository at github and push your code there.
